# Expected: both should have the value "Hello, World!"

# Test 2: Numeric scalar anchor
---
original: &num 42
copy: *num
another_copy: *num
# Expected: all three should have the value 42

# Test 3: Sequence anchor and alias
---
original_list: &my_list
  - apple
  - banana
  - cherry

copied_list: *my_list
# Expected: both lists should be identical

# Test 4: Mapping anchor and alias
---
original_map: &person
  name: Alice
  age: 30
  city: London

copied_map: *person
# Expected: both maps should be identical

# Test 5: Multiple anchors in same document
---
defaults: &defaults
  timeout: 30
  retries: 3

colors: &colors
  - red
  - green
  - blue

config:
  settings: *defaults
  palette: *colors
# Expected: config.settings should have timeout and retries, config.palette should have the color list

# Test 6: Nested structure with anchor
---
template: &template
  metadata:
    version: 1.0
    author: John Doe
  settings:
    enabled: true
    debug: false

instance1: *template
instance2: *template
# Expected: both instances should be identical copies of template

# Test 7: Anchor in sequence
---
items:
  - &first_item
    id: 1
    name: First
  - id: 2
    name: Second
  - *first_item
# Expected: first and third items should be identical

# Test 8: Multiple uses of same alias
---
shared_value: &shared 100
calculations:
  base: *shared
  doubled: 200  # Just a value, not calculated
  reference: *shared
  another_ref: *shared
# Expected: base, reference, and another_ref should all be 100

# Test 9: Boolean anchor
---
feature_flag: &enabled true
features:
  login: *enabled
  signup: *enabled
  export: *enabled
# Expected: all features should be true

# Test 10: Null anchor
---
empty: &null_value ~
values:
  first: *null_value
  second: *null_value
# Expected: all should be null

# Test 11: String with special characters
---
message: &msg |
  This is a multi-line
  message with some
  special content!

output1: *msg
output2: *msg
# Expected: both outputs should have the same multi-line string

# Test 12: Anchor in mapping value
---
database:
  primary: &db_config
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    ssl: true
  replica: *db_config
  backup: *db_config
