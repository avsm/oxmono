  "change_type": "mixed",
  "summary": "Add dune build support, OxCaml portability annotations, and Windows/macOS compatibility improvements.",
  "details": "- **Dune build support**: Added `dune`, `dune-project`, and `tests/dune` files for building with dune, including rules to run configure and extract CFLAGS/LIBS\n- **OxCaml annotations**: \n  - Added `@@ portable` annotations to all external C functions in `z.ml` and `z.mli`\n  - Added `@@portable` module annotation to `z.mli` and `q.mli`\n  - Changed type `t` to `t : immutable_data` in both Z and Q modules\n  - Added `global_` annotations to Q.t record fields\n  - Added `local_` parameter annotations for input strings, int32, int64, nativeint, and float values\n  - Added `compare__local` and `equal__local` variants for Q module\n  - Used `Callback.Safe.register_exception` instead of `Callback.register_exception`\n- **Configure improvements**:\n  - Added Windows (MSVC, mingw) support with proper suffix detection (`.obj`, `.lib`, `.dll`)\n  - Outputs `Makefile.config` instead of `Makefile` (separating config from build rules)\n  - Added `LIBSUFFIX`, `DLLSUFFIX`, `EXESUFFIX`, `WORDSIZE`, `STDLIBDIR` variables\n  - Bumped minimum OCaml version from 4.04 to 4.07\n- **Platform discovery**: Added `discover.ml` helper to auto-detect GMP include/lib paths on macOS (Homebrew arm64), FreeBSD, OpenBSD\n- **Build fixes**: Updated tests/Makefile to use variables from Makefile.config instead of hardcoding paths\n- **Minor fixes**: Typo fix in README (\"intergers\" → \"integers\"), optimized `Q.abs` to avoid allocation when number is already non-negative\n- **Removed**: `project.mak` file (replaced by dune build rules)"
