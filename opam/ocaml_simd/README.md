SIMD Libraries
==============

This set of libraries define native SIMD vector types and typed SIMD intrinsics.
They currently support 128/256-bit numeric types and amd64 intrinsics up to AVX2.

To use SIMD in your program, add the library `ocaml_simd_avx` and
the PPX `ppx_simd` to your `jbuild`.

- `ocaml_simd_avx` provides AVX vector types and operations.
  See the interface files under `/avx` for details.

- `ppx_simd` provides convenient type-checked syntax for specifying
  constants that modify the behavior of SIMD instructions.
  See [`/ppx`](ppx/README.md) for details.

- Note that the `ocaml_simd` library only provides cross-instruction-set
  abstract types and constant definitions. You do not need to depend on this
  library directly. Instead, these constants are generated by `ppx_simd`.
  See [`/src`](src/README.md) for details.

- A sexp parser may be found in `ocaml_simd_sexp`.  It uses SIMD
  instructions to achieve a performance improvement over `sexplib`'s parser.
  See `/sexp` for details.

The current set of libraries are intended for low-level use cases, and will form the
basis for a higher-level cross-platform library in the future.
