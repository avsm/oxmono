# SIMD Abstract Types

This library provides instruction-set-agnostic abstract types representing
control words for particular SIMD instructions.

Users should not call `ocaml_simd` directly: usage code is exclusively
generated by `ppx_simd`.

These definitions are encapsulated in their own library so that `ppx_simd`
may depend on an ISA-agnostic library, as opposed to a specific one like
`ocaml_simd_sse`. Therefore, `ppx_simd` may be used for a future
`ocaml_simd_avx` library, too.
