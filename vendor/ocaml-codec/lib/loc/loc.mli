(** Text locations: byte ranges and line positions.

    A location identifies a span within a UTF-8 encoded file by an inclusive
    range of absolute byte positions and the line positions on which they occur.
    Designed for parser error reporting; the representation is compatible with
    the OCaml compiler's format and the GNU error convention. *)

(** {1:fpath File paths} *)

type fpath = string
(** The type for file paths. *)

val file_none : fpath
(** [file_none] is ["-"]. A file path to use when there is none. *)

(** {1:pos Positions} *)

(** {2:byte_pos Byte positions} *)

type byte_pos = int
(** The type for zero-based, absolute byte positions in text. If the text has
    [n] bytes, [0] is the first position and [n-1] is the last position. *)

val byte_pos_none : byte_pos
(** [byte_pos_none] is [-1]. A position to use when there is none. *)

val compare_byte_pos : byte_pos -> byte_pos -> int
(** [compare_byte_pos] orders byte positions by their distance from the start of
    the text, so {!byte_pos_none} sorts before every real position. *)

(** {2:lines Lines} *)

type line_num = int
(** The type for one-based line numbers. Lines increment after a newline which
    is either a line feed ['\n'] (U+000A), a carriage return ['\r'] (U+000D), or
    a carriage return followed by a line feed ["\r\n"] (<U+000D,U+000A>). *)

(** {2:line_pos Line positions}

    A line position is a line number paired with the absolute byte position
    following its newline (or the start of text for the first line). That byte
    position:
    - indexes the first byte of the line if it is non-empty;
    - indexes the first byte of the next newline sequence if the line is empty;
    - is out of bounds and equal to the text's length for a last empty line
      (also the case on empty text). *)

(** {1:tloc Text locations} *)

type t
(** The type for text locations. If the first byte equals the last byte the
    range contains exactly that byte. If the first byte is greater than the last
    byte the location represents an insertion point before the first byte; in
    that case last-position information should be ignored. *)

    to [last_byte] of [file], on the lines those two byte positions start. Use
    {!file_none} when there is no file. *)

(** [is_empty t] is [true] iff [first_byte t > last_byte t]. *)

(** [to_first l] has both positions set to [l]'s first position. *)

(** [to_last l] has both positions set to [l]'s last position. *)

val before : t -> t
(** [before l] is the empty location at {!val-first_byte}, on [l]'s first line.
*)

val after : t -> t
(** [after l] is the empty location at [last_byte + 1], on [l]'s last line. *)

val span : t -> t -> t
(** [span l0 l1] covers from the smallest first byte of either to the largest
    last byte of either. File is taken from the location with the greater last
    byte. *)

(** {2:fmt Formatting} *)

val pp_ocaml : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
(** [pp_ocaml ppf l] formats [l] like the OCaml compiler:
    [File "f.ml", line 3, characters 10-15]. *)

  (** [v ~ws_before ~ws_after ~text loc] is the metadata with source location
      [loc], preceded by the whitespace [ws_before] and followed by [ws_after]

  (** [text m] is the source text {!val-loc} indexes into, when the parser that

      A node that has it can be written back byte for byte by slicing [text] at
      [loc], layout and all, without re-rendering anything from the value the
      node denotes. That is what a parser records it for, and it is also the
      claim it makes: a node given a parsed node's metadata says its bytes are
      those bytes, so a value built by hand out of one takes the layout along
      with the location. Build such a value with {!val-v} on the location alone
      -- see {!val-clear_text} -- and it is rendered rather than copied.

      Every node of one document shares one string, so keeping it costs a word
      per node rather than a copy per node. *)

  (** [with_loc m loc] is [m] with source location set to [loc]. *)

  val with_text : t -> string -> t
  (** [with_text m text] is [m] reading into [text]. *)

  (** [clear_text m] is [m] with no source text: it keeps where the node was and
      drops the claim that the bytes there are still its own. This is what puts
      a replacement in an existing document -- the location says which bytes it
      takes the place of, and the missing text says they have to be written
      afresh. *)

  val clear_ws : t -> t
  (** [clear_ws m] is [m] with both whitespace fields cleared. *)

  val clear_loc : t -> t
  (** [clear_loc m] is [m] with its source location set to {!none}. *)

(** {1:paths Structural paths}

    Paths address sub-values in a structured document. The step alphabet is
    extensible: {!Path.extension-Mem} and {!Path.extension-Nth} are the baseline
    for name-addressed and index-addressed descent; formats add their own native
    steps (XML [Attribute], CBOR [Cbor_key], protobuf [Field_number], ...) via
    extension constructors and register printers for them. *)

  val pp_step : Format.formatter -> step -> unit
  (** [pp_step] formats a step without source location, via the registry. *)

  type t
  (** The type for paths. Internally leaf-to-root (last step at the head) for

  (** [is_root p] is [true] iff [p] is {!root}. *)

(** {1:context Navigation contexts}

    A context describes {b where} in a structured document we are: the full
    {!Path.t} from the root, plus the {e sort} label of each parent container.
    Errors hold a context (pointing at the offending node); cursors produce a

      A tool printing a decode failure to a terminal wants this one: the first
      line still carries the [file:line:col:] prefix editors match on, and the
      label says the diagnostic is an error rather than a warning. An error with
      no location opens on the label, which is also where OCaml puts it. *)
